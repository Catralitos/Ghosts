# Ghosts

Ghosts of the Deep is a maze-style game, where a diver has to collect air bubbles to increase its score and pearls to eat enemies. When it eats all the bubbles in the maze, it wins.

In this game, however, you play as the enemies. They will ordinarily wander randomly through the maze, but the player can left-click to select them and right-click on a point of the maze to send them there. The objective is to quickly kill the diver to prevent him from winning.

The second player can control the diver using the WASD keys in two-player mode.
